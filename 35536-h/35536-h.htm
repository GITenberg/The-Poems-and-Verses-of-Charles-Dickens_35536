<p class="center">THE VILLAGE COQUETTES</p>

<p>About the year 1834, when the earliest of the <i>Sketches by Boz</i> were
appearing in print, a young composer named John Hullah set to music a
portion of an opera called <i>The Gondolier</i>, which he thought might prove
successful on the stage. Twelve months later Hullah became acquainted with
Charles Dickens, whose name was then unknown to those outside his own
immediate circle, and it occurred to him that he and &#8216;Boz&#8217; might combine
their forces by converting <i>The Gondolier</i> into a popular play. Dickens,
who always entertained a passion for the theatre, entered into the project
at once, and informed Hullah that he had a little unpublished story by him
which he thought would dramatise well&mdash;even better than <i>The Gondolier</i>
notion; confessing that he would rather deal with familiar English scenes
than with the unfamiliar Venetian environment of the play favoured by
Hullah. The title of <i>The Gondolier</i> was consequently abandoned, and a
novel subject found and put forward as <i>The Village Coquettes</i>, a comic
opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> of which songs, duets, and concerted pieces were to form
constituent parts. Dickens, of course, became responsible for the
<i>libretto</i> and Hullah for the music; and when completed the little play
was offered to, and accepted by, Braham, the lessee of the St. James&#8217;s
Theatre, who expressed an earnest desire to be the first to introduce
&#8216;Boz&#8217; to the public as a dramatic writer. A favourite comedian of that
day, John Pritt Harley, after reading the words of the opera prior to its
representation, declared it was &#8216;a sure card,&#8217; and felt so confident of
its success that he offered to wager ten pounds that it would run fifty
nights!&mdash;an assurance which at once decided Braham to produce it.</p>

<p><i>The Village Coquettes</i>, described on the title-page of the printed copies
as &#8216;A Comic Opera, in Two Acts,&#8217; was played for the first time on December
6, 1836, with Braham and Harley in the cast. In his preface to the play
(published contemporaneously by Richard Bentley, and dedicated to Harley)
Dickens explained that &#8216;the <i>libretto</i> of an opera must be, to a certain
extent, a mere vehicle for the music,&#8217; and that &#8216;it is scarcely fair or
reasonable to judge it by those strict rules of criticism which would be
justly applicable to a five-act tragedy or a finished comedy.&#8217; There is no
doubt that the merits of the play were based upon the songs set to
Hullah&#8217;s music rather than upon the play itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> and it is said that
Harley&#8217;s reputation as a vocalist was established by his able rendering of
them.</p>

<p><i>The Village Coquettes</i> enjoyed a run of nineteen nights in London during
the season, and was then transferred to Edinburgh, where it was performed
under the management of Mr. Ramsay, a friend of Sir Walter Scott. Sala, as
a boy of ten, witnessed its first representation in London, and ever
retained a vivid impression of the event; while especial interest
appertains to the fact that a copy of the play became the means of first
bringing Dickens into personal communication with John Forster, his
life-long friend and biographer. It is more than probable that &#8216;Boz&#8217; felt
a little elated by the reception accorded by the public to the &#8216;dramatic
bantling,&#8217; but as time progressed he realised that the somewhat
unfavourable comments of the critics were not entirely devoid of truth.
Indeed, when in 1843 it was proposed to revive the play, he expressed a
hope that it might be allowed &#8216;to sink into its native obscurity.&#8217; &#8216;I did
it,&#8217; he explained, &#8216;in a fit of damnable good-nature long ago, for Hullah,
who wrote some very pretty music to it. I just put down for everybody what
everybody at the St. James&#8217;s Theatre wanted to say and do, and what they
could say and do best, and I have been most sincerely repentant ever
since.&#8217; The novelist confessed that both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> operetta and a little farce
called <i>The Strange Gentleman</i> (the latter written as &#8216;a practical joke&#8217;
for the St. James&#8217;s Theatre about the same time) were done &#8216;without the
least consideration or regard to reputation&#8217;; he also declared that he
&#8216;wouldn&#8217;t repeat them for a thousand pounds apiece,&#8217; and devoutly wished
these early dramatic efforts to be forgotten. <i>&Agrave; propos</i> of this, the late
Frederick Locker-Lampson has recorded that when he asked Dickens (about a
year before the great writer&#8217;s death) whether he possessed a copy of <i>The
Village Coquettes</i>, his reply was, &#8216;No; and if I knew it was in my house,
and if I could not get rid of it in any other way, I would burn the wing
of the house where it was!&#8217;</p>

<p>Although, perhaps, not of a high order of merit, <i>The Village Coquettes</i>
is not without bibliographical interest, and may be regarded as a musical
and literary curiosity. Copies of the first edition of the little play are
now seldom met with, and whenever a perfect impression comes into the
market it commands a good price, even as much as &pound;10 or &pound;12,&mdash;indeed, a
particularly fine copy was sold at Sotheby&#8217;s in 1889 for twenty-five
pounds. In 1878 the words of the opera were reprinted in facsimile by
Richard Bentley, for which a frontispiece was etched by F. W. Pailthorpe a
year later.</p>

<p class="center">THE LAMPLIGHTER</p>

<p>In 1838 Dickens agreed to prepare a little play for Macready, the famous
actor, then the manager of Drury Lane Theatre. It was called <i>The
Lamplighter</i>, and when completed the author read aloud the &#8216;unfortunate
little farce&#8217; (as he subsequently termed it) in the greenroom of the
theatre. Although the play went through rehearsal, it was never presented
before an audience, for the actors would not agree about it, and, at
Macready&#8217;s suggestion, Dickens consented to withdraw it, declaring that he
had &#8216;no other feeling of disappointment connected with this matter&#8217; but
that which arose from the failure in attempting to serve his friend. The
manuscript of the play, not in Dickens&#8217;s handwriting, reposes in the
Forster Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and in 1879 it was
printed for the first time, in the form of a pamphlet, of which only two
hundred and fifty copies were issued.</p>

<p>When rejected by Macready as unsuitable for stage presentation, <i>The
Lamplighter</i> was adapted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> Dickens to another purpose&mdash;that is to say,
he converted it into a tale called <i>The Lamplighter&#8217;s Story</i>, for
publication in <i>The Pic-Nic Papers</i>, issued in 1841 for the benefit of the
widow of Macrone, Dickens&#8217;s first publisher, who died in great poverty.
Between the farce and the story there are but slight differences. The duet
of two verses, sung by Tom and Betsy to the air of &#8216;The Young May-moon,&#8217;
cannot of course be regarded as a remarkable composition, but it served
its purpose sufficiently well, and for that reason deserves recognition.</p>

<p class="center">THE IVY GREEN</p>

<p>This famous ballad of three verses, from the sixth chapter of <i>Pickwick</i>,
is perhaps the most acceptable of all Dickens&#8217;s poetical efforts. It was
originally set to music, at Dickens&#8217;s request, by his brother-in-law,
Henry Burnett, a professional vocalist, who, by the way, was the admitted
prototype of Nicholas Nickleby. Mr. Burnett sang the ballad scores of
times in the presence of literary men and artists, and it proved an
especial favourite with Landor. &#8216;The Ivy Green&#8217; was not written for
<i>Pickwick</i>, Mr. Burnett assured me; but on its being so much admired the
author said it should go into a monthly number, and it did. The most
popular setting is undoubtedly that of Henry Russell, who has recorded
that he received, as his fee, the magnificent sum of ten shillings! The
ballad, in this form, went into many editions, and the sales must have
amounted to tens of thousands.</p>

<p class="center">GABRIEL GRUB&#8217;S SONG</p>

<p>The Sexton&#8217;s melancholy dirge, in the twenty-ninth chapter of <i>Pickwick</i>,
seems a little incongruous in a humorous work. The sentiment, however,
thoroughly accords with the philosophic gravedigger&#8217;s gruesome occupation.
&#8216;The Story of the Goblins who Stole a Sexton&#8217; is one of several short
tales (chiefly of a dismal character) introduced into <i>Pickwick</i>; they
were doubtless written prior to the conception of <i>Pickwick</i>, each being
probably intended for independent publication, and in a manner similar to
the &#8216;Boz&#8217; Sketches. For some reason these stories were not so published,
and Dickens evidently saw a favourable opportunity of utilising his unused
manuscripts by inserting them in <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that while Sam Weller and his coaching-friends
refreshed themselves at the little public-house opposite the Insolvent
Court in Portugal Street, Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields, prior to Sam joining Mr.
Pickwick in the Fleet, that faithful body-servant was persuaded to &#8216;oblige
the company&#8217; with a song. &#8216;Raly, gentlemen,&#8217; said Sam, &#8216;I&#8217;m not wery much
in the habit o&#8217; singin&#8217; vithout the instrument; but anythin&#8217; for a quiet
life, as the man said ven he took the sitivation at the light-house.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;With this prelude, Mr. Samuel Weller burst at once into the following
wild and beautiful legend, which, under the impression that it is not
generally known, we take the liberty of quoting. We would beg to call
particular attention to the monosyllable at the end of the second and
fourth lines, which not only enables the singer to take breath at those
points, but greatly assists the metre.&#8217;-<i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, chapter
xliii.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the performance the mottled-faced gentleman contended
that the song was &#8216;personal to the cloth,&#8217; and demanded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> name of the
bishop&#8217;s coachman, whose cowardice he regarded as a reflection upon
coachmen in general. Sam replied that his name was not known, as &#8216;he
hadn&#8217;t got his card in his pocket&#8217;; whereupon the mottled-faced gentleman
declared the statement to be untrue, stoutly maintaining that the said
coachman did <i>not</i> run away, but &#8216;died game&mdash;game as pheasants,&#8217; and he
would &#8216;hear nothin&#8217; said to the contrairey.&#8217;</p>

<p>Even in the vernacular (observes Mr. Percy Fitzgerald), &#8216;this master of
words [Charles Dickens] could be artistic; and it may fairly be asserted
that Mr. Weller&#8217;s song to the coachmen is superior to anything of the kind
that has appeared since.&#8217; The two stanzas have been set to music, as a
humorous part-song, by Sir Frederick Bridge, Mus. Doc., M.V.O., the
organist of Westminster Abbey, who informs me that it was written some
years since, to celebrate a festive gathering in honour of Dr. Turpin (!),
Secretary of the College of Organists. &#8216;It has had a very great success,&#8217;
says Sir Frederick, &#8216;and is sung much in the North of England at
competitions of choirs. It is for men&#8217;s voices. The humour of the words
never fails to make a great hit, and I hope the music does no harm. &#8220;The
Bishop&#8217;s Coach&#8221; is set to a bit of old Plain-Chant, and I introduce a
Fugue at the words &#8220;Sure as eggs is eggs.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p class="center">POLITICAL SQUIBS FROM &#8216;THE EXAMINER,&#8217; 1841</p>

<p>In August 1841 Dickens contributed anonymously to <i>The Examiner</i> (then
edited by Forster) three political squibs, which were signed W., and were
intended to help the Liberals in fighting their opponents. These squibs
were entitled respectively &#8216;The Fine Old English Gentleman (to be said or
sung at all Conservative Dinners)&#8217;; &#8216;The Quack Doctor&#8217;s Proclamation&#8217;; and
&#8216;Subjects for Painters (after Peter Pindar).&#8217; Concerning those
productions, Forster says: &#8216;I doubt if he ever enjoyed anything more than
the power of thus taking part occasionally, unknown to outsiders, in the
sharp conflict the press was waging at the time.&#8217; In all probability he
contributed other political rhymes to the pages of <i>The Examiner</i> as
events prompted: if so, they are buried beyond easy reach of
identification.</p>

<p>Writing to Forster at this time, Dickens said: &#8216;By Jove, how Radical I am
getting! I wax stronger and stronger in the true principles every day.&#8217;...
He would (observes Forster) sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> even talk, in moments of sudden
indignation at the political outlook, &#8216;of carrying off himself and his
household gods, like Coriolanus, to a world elsewhere.&#8217; This was the
period of the Tory interregnum, with Sir Robert Peel at the head of
affairs.</p>

<p class="center">PROLOGUE TO &#8216;THE PATRICIAN&#8217;S DAUGHTER&#8217;</p>

<p><i>The Patrician&#8217;s Daughter</i> was the title bestowed upon a play, in the
tragic vein, by a then unknown writer, J. Westland Marston, it being his
maiden effort in dramatic authorship. Dickens took great interest in the
young man and indicated a desire to promote the welfare of his production
by composing some introductory lines. To Macready he wrote: &#8216;The more I
think of Marston&#8217;s play, the more sure I feel that a prologue to the
purpose would help it materially, and almost decide the fate of any
ticklish point on the first night. Now I have an idea (not easily
explainable in writing, but told in five words) that would take the
prologue out of the conventional dress of prologues, quite. Get the
curtain up with a dash, and begin the play with a sledge-hammer blow. If,
on consideration, you should agree with me, I will write the prologue,
heartily.&#8217; Happily for the author, his little tragedy was the first new
play of the season, and it thus attracted greater attention. Its initial
representation took place at Drury Lane Theatre on December 10, 1842, and
the fact that Dickens&#8217;s dignified and vigorous lines were recited by
Macready, the leading actor of his day, undoubtedly gave <i>prestige</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> to
this performance; but the play, although it made a sensation for the
moment, did not enjoy a long run, its motive being for some reason
misunderstood. As explained by the Editors of <i>The Letters of Charles
Dickens</i>, it was (to a certain extent) an experiment in testing the effect
of a tragedy of modern times and in modern dress, the novelist&#8217;s Prologue
being intended to show that there need be no incongruity between plain
clothes of the nineteenth century and high tragedy.</p>

<p><i>The Patrician&#8217;s Daughter: A Tragedy in Five Acts</i>, appeared in pamphlet
form during the year prior to its being placed upon the boards. The
Prologue was printed for the first time in the <i>Sunday Times</i>, December
11, 1842, and then in <i>The Theatrical Journal and Stranger&#8217;s Guide</i>,
December 17, 1842. By the kind permission of Miss Hogarth, the lines are
here reproduced from the revised and only correct version in <i>The Letters
of Charles Dickens</i>.</p>

<p>In the preface to the second edition of the play (1842), the author thus
acknowledges his indebtedness to Dickens for the Prologue, which, however,
does not appear in the book: &#8216;How shall I thank Mr. Dickens for the
spontaneous kindness which has furnished me with so excellent a letter of
introduction to the audience? The simplest acknowledgment is perhaps the
best, since the least I might say would exceed <i>his</i> estimate of the
obligation; while the most I could say would fail to express <i>mine</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p class="center">A WORD IN SEASON</p>

<p><i>The Keepsake</i>, one of the many fashionable annuals published during the
early years of Queen Victoria&#8217;s reign, had for its editor in 1844 the
&#8216;gorgeous&#8217; Countess of Blessington, the reigning beauty who held court at
Gore House, Kensington, where many political, artistic, and literary
celebrities forgathered&mdash;Bulwer Lytton, Disraeli, Dickens, Ainsworth,
D&#8217;Orsay, and the rest. Her ladyship, through her personal charm and
natural gifts, succeeded in securing the services of eminent authors for
the aristocratic publication; even Dickens could not resist her appeal,
and in a letter to Forster (dated July 1843) he wrote: &#8216;I have heard, as
you have, from Lady Blessington, for whose behalf I have this morning
penned the lines I send you herewith. But I have only done so to excuse
myself, for I have not the least idea of their suiting her; and I hope she
will send them back to you for <i>The Examiner</i>.&#8217; Lady Blessington, however,
decided to retain the thoughtful little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> poem, which was referred to in
the <i>London Review</i> (twenty-three years later) as &#8216;a graceful and sweet
apologue, reminding one of the manner of Hood.&#8217; The theme of the poem,
which Forster describes as &#8216;a clever and pointed parable in verse,&#8217; was
afterwards satirised in Chadband (<i>Bleak House</i>), and in the idea of
religious conversion through the agency of &#8216;moral pocket-handkerchiefs.&#8217;</p>

<p class="center">VERSES FROM THE &#8216;DAILY NEWS,&#8217; 1846</p>

<p>The <i>Daily News</i>, it will be remembered, was founded in January 1846 by
Charles Dickens, who officiated as its first editor. He soon sickened of
the mechanical drudgery appertaining to the position, and resigned his
editorial functions the following month. From January 21st to March 2nd he
contributed to its columns a series of &#8216;Travelling Sketches,&#8217; afterwards
reprinted in volume form as <i>Pictures from Italy</i>. He also availed himself
of the opportunity afforded him, by his association with that newspaper,
of once more taking up the cudgels against the Tories, and, as in the case
of the <i>Examiner</i>, his attack was conveyed through the medium of some
doggerel verses. These were entitled &#8216;The British Lion&mdash;A New Song, but an
Old Story,&#8217; to be sung to the tune of &#8216;The Great Sea-Snake.&#8217; They bore the
signature of &#8216;Catnach,&#8217; the famous ballad-singer, and were printed in the
<i>Daily News</i> of January 24, 1846.</p>

<p>Three weeks later some verses of a totally different character appeared in
the columns of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> <i>Daily News</i>, signed in full &#8216;Charles Dickens.&#8217; One
Lucy Simpkins, of Bremhill (or Bremble), a parish in Wiltshire, had just
previously addressed a night meeting of the wives of agricultural
labourers in that county, in support of a petition for Free Trade, and her
vigorous speech on that occasion inspired Dickens to write &#8216;The Hymn of
the Wiltshire Labourers,&#8217; thus offering an earnest protest against
oppression. Concerning the &#8216;Hymn,&#8217; a writer in a recent issue of
<i>Christmas Bells</i> observes: &#8216;It breathes in every line the teaching of the
Sermon on the Mount, the love of the All-Father, the Redemption by His
Son, and that love to God and man on which hang all the law and the
prophets.&#8217;</p>

<p>Dickens, like Silas Wegg, would sometimes &#8216;drop into poetry&#8217; when writing

<p>A more remarkable instance of his propensity to indulge in parody of this
kind is to be found in a letter addressed to Mark Lemon in the spring of
1849. The novelist was then enjoying a holiday with his wife and daughters

pay them a visit. After commanding him to &#8216;get a clean pocket-handkerchief

<p class="center">&#8216;THE LIGHTHOUSE&#8217;</p>

<p>Wilkie Collins composed two powerful dramas for representation at
Dickens&#8217;s residence, Tavistock House, a portion of which had been already
adapted for private theatricals, the rooms so converted being described in
the bills as &#8216;The Smallest Theatre in the World.&#8217; The first of these plays
was called <i>The Lighthouse</i>, and the initial performance took place on
June 19, 1855. Dickens not only wrote the Prologue and &#8216;The Song of the
Wreck,&#8217; but signally distinguished himself by enacting the part of Aaron
Gurnock, a lighthouse-keeper, his clever impersonation recalling Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rick
Lema&icirc;tre, the only actor he ever tried to take as a model.</p>

<p>With regard to &#8216;The Song of the Wreck,&#8217; Dickens evidently intended to
bestow upon it a different title, for, in a letter addressed to Wilkie
Collins during the preparation of the play, he said: &#8216;I have written a
little ballad for Mary&mdash;&#8220;The Story of the Ship&#8217;s Carpenter and the Little
Boy, in the Shipwreck.&#8221;&#8217; The song was rendered by his eldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> daughter,
Mary (who assumed the r&ocirc;le of Ph&oelig;be in the play); it was set to the
music composed by George Linley for Miss Charlotte Young&#8217;s pretty ballad,
&#8216;Little Nell,&#8217; of which Dickens became very fond, and which his daughter
had been in the habit of singing to him constantly since her childhood.
Dr. A. W. Ward, Master of Peter-house, Cambridge University, refers to
&#8216;The Song of the Wreck&#8217; as &#8216;a most successful effort in Cowper&#8217;s
manner.&#8217;</p>

<p>The second drama written by Wilkie Collins for the Tavistock House Theatre
was first acted there in January 1857, and subsequently at the Gallery of
Illustration in the presence of Queen Victoria and the Royal Family. As in
the case of <i>The Lighthouse</i>, the play had the advantage of a Prologue in
rhyme by Charles Dickens, who again electrified his audiences by
marvellous acting, the character of Richard Wardour (a young naval
officer) being selected by him for representation.</p>

<p>The Prologue was recited at Tavistock House by John Forster, and at the
public performances of the play by Dickens himself.</p>

<p>It is not generally known that a by no means inconsiderable portion of the
drama was composed by Dickens, as testified by the original manuscripts of
the play and of the prompt-book, which contain numerous additions and
corrections in his handwriting. These manuscripts, by the way, realised
&pound;300 at Sotheby&#8217;s in 1890.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>The main idea of <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> was conceived by Dickens when
performing in <i>The Frozen Deep</i>. &#8216;A strong desire was upon me then,&#8217; he
writes in the preface to the story, &#8216;to embody it in my own person; and I
traced out in my fancy the state of mind of which it would necessitate the
presentation to an observant spectator, with particular care and interest.
As the idea became familiar to me, it gradually shaped itself into its
present form. Throughout its execution, it has had complete possession of
me: I have so far verified what is done and suffered in these pages, as
that I have certainly done and suffered it all myself.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Christmas number of <i>Household Words</i> for 1856 is especially
noteworthy as containing the Hymn of five verses which Dickens contributed
to the second chapter. This made a highly favourable impression, and a
certain clergyman, the Rev. R. H. Davies, was induced to express to the
editor of <i>Household Words</i> his gratitude to the author of these lines for
having thus conveyed to innumerable readers such true religious
sentiments. In acknowledging the receipt of the letter, Dickens observed
that such a mark of approval was none the less gratifying to him because
he was himself the author of the Hymn. &#8216;There cannot be many men, I
believe,&#8217; he added, &#8216;who have a more humble veneration for the New
Testament, or a more profound conviction of its all-sufficiency, than I
have. If I am ever (as you tell me I am) mistaken on this subject, it is
because I discountenance all obtrusive professions of and tradings in
religion, as one of the main causes why real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> Christianity has been
retarded in this world; and because my observation of life induces me to
hold in unspeakable dread and horror those unseemly squabbles about the
letter which drive the spirit out of hundreds of thousands.&#8217;&mdash;<i>Vide</i>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
